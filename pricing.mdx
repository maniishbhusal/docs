## What's a Credit?

One credit = one PDF conversion. Simple as that.

| Action | Credits |
|--------|---------|
| Convert HTML to PDF | 1 |
| Convert URL to PDF | 1 |

## Rate Limits

Rate limits are per minute and reset every 60 seconds.

| Plan | Requests/Minute |
|------|-----------------|
| Free | 10 |
| Starter | 30 |
| Pro | 100 |

If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Wait for the limit to reset and retry.

## Credit Rollover

Credits do **not** roll over to the next month. Unused credits expire at the end of each billing period.

## Upgrading

Upgrade anytime from your [dashboard settings](https://pdflet.dev/dashboard?settings=billing). You'll be prorated for the current billing period.

## Downgrading

Downgrade takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You'll keep your current plan's limits until then.

## Enterprise

Need more than 5,000 credits/month or custom rate limits?
